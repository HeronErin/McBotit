# McBotit FabricMc client
This is a companion mod for the main [python client](https://github.com/HeronErin/McBotItPython). This mod can be used with baritone, but this is optional and not required. Baritone will give you access to high quality path finding, but all other parts of the tool can be used without it. The mod automaticly detects if baritone is installed and unlocks certain features if it is.


<b>If you choose to use baritone, you must use the API or unoptimised fabric builds</b>
